# CAT Data Science Workshop Schedule

# Preparing for the workshop
### Please bring:
* your computer with R and RStudio installed (see below) and your powercord
* a water bottle (to cut down on packaging waste, drinks won't be provided with lunch)

Please follow the installation instructions posted here: https://github.com/strongh/ClimateActionR/blob/master/R_installation.Rmd

## Pre-workshop technical office hour (optional)
**Friday March 11, 12-1pm**

**Location: BioSci III room 3120**

If you have never used R and RStudio, please come to our pre-workshop office hour.  Will and Homer will be there to assist with installation of these two programs.

# Milestones
| Milestone | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1 -- Select question & datasets | Choose a [project question][quest] and identify the [relevant datasets][data] |
| 2 -- Plan & assign tasks | Identify component tasks to answer question, plan analyses, and assign roles to group members |
| 3 -- Preliminary analysis & reflection | Complete preliminary analyses (e.g. summary statistics) and evaluate data suitability |
| 4 -- Background research | Relate analyses to previous research on the topic (e.g. what has been found, how has it been communicated?) |
| 5 -- Revisit question | Revisit suitability of datasets for the question and reframe the question as needed |
| 6 -- Team check-in | Evaluate the remaining tasks, assignments to team members, and question |
| 7 -- Start Shiny app | Craft the message, layout, and code for Shiny app (it's ok to use dummy data if the analyses aren't done) |
| 8 -- Minimum viable app | Finish a minimum viable Shiny app that addresses the selected question and collect team member feedback |
| 9 -- Limitations | Explicitly identify the assumptions, caveats, and limitations of the data and analyses |
