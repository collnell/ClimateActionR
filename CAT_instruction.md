# Climate Action Training Instruction
This document outlines the plan for teaching during the first section of the Climate Action Training workshop. The goal is to introduce graduate students from backgroundds to skills that will be useful for executing an open-ended data analysis project during the later part of the workshop. To be useful to both those experience with R as well as those who are new to programming, we will try to connect concrete examples directly to important concepts.

The schedule of the instructional day will include a lot of time for the participants to apply the tools. The tentative structure is to start off with a question of interest that would guide the lesson to demonstrate how our own question might be addressed using the available datasets.

The below topics may be out of order.

## Topics
+ spatial data formats
  + points
  + shapes
  + projections
  + raster
+ temporal data
  + calendar time vs. eg UNIX epoch time
  + aggregating by bucket
+ sources of climate data
  + models (e.g. GCMs)
  + paleo sources
  + remote sensing
  + ...
+ summarizations
  + dplyr
+ statistical topics
  + Simpson's paradox
  + geospatial models
+ visualization
  + mapping
  + shiny
  + cholorpleths
