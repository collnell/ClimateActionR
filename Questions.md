# Questions for CAT Workshop

(1) How can agricultural land use and crop composition in Southern California be adjusted to accommodate changes in water availability as climate changes?

(2) Is fallowing agricultural land an effective strategy to alleviate drinking water shortages in Southern California?

(3) How will climate change and human water use alter the salinity of the Colorado River, and what are the implications of these changes for downstream water users?

(4) How should water rights be allocated among the Upper Colorado River Basin, the Lower Colorado Basin, and the Colorado River Delta to maximize water security across the basin?

(5) How do increases in temperature affect demand (i.e. water use) vs supply (i.e. precipitation/snowmelt)?

(6) How much water should be stored to ensure water security in future droughts?

(7) How will climate change and water allocation constraints alter hydroelectric energy production along the Colorado River?

(8) How will changes in hardiness zones affect crop water use in the upper basin?

(9) How does water security interact with food security (e.g. do we import more food during droughts)?
 
(10) How is the presence and severity of drought related to peopleâ€™s awareness/interest in drought?
